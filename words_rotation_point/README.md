# WORDS ROTATION POINT

Write a function `rotation_point` that takes a list of words and finds the location of the rotation point.

Words are taken in order starting from some random point in a dictionary. The rotation point is the location of the first word that comes from the front of the dictionary.

**Example**

```
words = [
  'man',
  'myth',
  'orange',
  'zybra',
  'apple', <- rotation point
  'bark',
  'coin'
]

rotation_point(words) == 4 # True
```
